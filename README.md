# Aura
after 7 months of coding, it's being released.

Tested so it works on basically every executor, given that it's not less than 30 unc (but why are you using one with that unc anyway?)


## da hood/hood customs script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stratxgy/Aura/refs/heads/main/main-dh.lua'))()
```
## universal roblox (all games) script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stratxgy/Aura/refs/heads/main/universal.lua'))()
```
